  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - public/assets/app_icon/
    - public/assets/
    - public/assets/fonts/
    - public/assets/images/
    - lang/en.json
    - .env
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
#   fonts:
#     - family: Schyler
#       fonts:
#         - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
#         - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
#           style: italic
#     - family: Trajan Pro
#       fonts:
#         - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
#         - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
#           weight: 700
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
